All files must be placed in one folder with data.

To compile program run: 
g++ -Ofast -ffast-math *.cpp *.h -o PetriDishModel

It can be executed by:
./PetriDishModel A B C
where:
A - thickness of cluster
B - start id
C - end id

For example: ./PetriDishModel 5 0 2 will generate eight files:
DENSITY5.00Id0.csv
DENSITY5.00Id1.csv
SD5.00Id1.csv
SD5.00Id0.csv
MRNLC5.00Id1.csv
MRNLC5.00Id0.csv

Make averege result for each cluster thickness can be done by average.py.

And after that you can use finalResults.py for generate densities.dat - final result which is
use for generate plot.
