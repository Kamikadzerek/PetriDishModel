All files must be placed in one folder with data.

To compile program run: 
g++ -Ofast -ffast-math *.cpp *.h -o PetriDishModel

It can be executed by:
./PetriDishModel A B C
where:
A - thickness of cluster
B - start id
C - end id

For example: ./PetriDishModel 5 0 4 will generate four files:
DENSITY5.00Id0.csv
DENSITY5.00Id1.csv
DENSITY5.00Id2.csv
DENSITY5.00Id3.csv

By genJobs.py you can customizing and generate list of execiutions of PetriDishModel into
jobs file.

By run.sh you can executed command from jobs pararel(param N in the script)

After execute run.sh you will have set of data.
Make averege result for each cluster thickness can be done by average.py.

And after that you can use density.py for generate densities.dat - final result which is
use for generate plot.
